# ExcelProject_cleaningData
This is a small project to practice cleaning data using Excel
Unclean data was provided by the Coursera Excel Basics for Data Analysis course, I worked on cleaning the data:
- Used Filters to remove empty rows
- Used Conditional Formatting and Remove Duplicate Feature to remove the redundant data.
- Checked the spelling mistakes and used the replace method to correct them.
-  Used Find and Replace feature to remove all double-spaces from the data.
- Used Flash Fill to reduce department names to just one column, and removed the unnecessary columns.
